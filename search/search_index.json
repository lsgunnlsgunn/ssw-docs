For example, an organization might be a global business, a school district, or a regional government agency. However, organizations aren't defined by their size. Organization are defined by the scope of what they contain. Each organization is an independent entity with its own users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies. For example, an enterprise with multiple divisions might have separate organizations for engineering and sales because engineering and sales have very different sets of users and applications to manage and because they share very little infrastructure. It's important to keep this separation in mind because each organization is managed completely independent from all other organizations. Users in one organization don't have access to resources in any other organization. If you have an account that's assigned the Org Admin role, the separation between organizations is transparent because you only ever see the users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies for your own organization. However, if you have an account that's assigned the Super Admin role, you can create and manage multiple organizations. If you manage multiple organizations, it's important to keep your current context in mind. After you select the organization you want to work with, every task you perform in the administrative portal is specific to the organization you selected. Create a new organization The Super Admin role is typically used by third-party service providers who manage independent network infrastructures for multiple clients. Beyond the service provider use case, few organizations need the Super Admin role or the ability to create an manage new organizations. If you have an account that's been assigned the Super Admin role, your first step is create one or more organizations.

A unified policy can simplify policy management because you can create one policy to control the following: User authentication Application access Network access Permission to Read secrets Permission to Write secrets Permission to Update secrets For each control, you can specify conditions that allow access, require multifactor authentication, or deny access. The flexibility of being able to combine multiple controls and conditions in one policy can be powerful, especially for controls that you want broadly applied across the organization. However, combining multiple controls in one policy can also lead to complexity in keeping track of all the conditions to be evaluated. In general, you should use a unified policy to consolidate controls that you want to enforce across your organization infrastructure. You can then use specialized policies to provide more targeted controls for specific applications, secrets, or groups. Defining multiple unified policies Although you can define one unified policy that includes all of the access controls, it's often useful to define multiple unified policies. For example, you might want to define one unified policy focused on basic user authentication and a second unified policy focused on restricting network access to a specific subnet address range. In some cases, the clarity of separating the purpose of each policy outweighs the overhead of managing two unified policies instead of one. Actions, events, and conditions Every control in a unified policy has a default action to take when a triggering event\u2014such as an authentication request or an attempt to access the network\u2014occurs. For any control, you can change the default action or set conditions to be evaluated that can result in a change to the action taken. For example, if the default action is to deny access and you don't define any conditions that allow access or that allow access with multifactor authentication, all access requests are denied. You can define one or more conditions that must be met to all access or to allow access with multifactor authentication. If none of the conditions are satisfied, the default action to deny access is enforced. Groups and policy evaluation Unified policies are always applied based on group membership. When you create a unified policy, you must specify one or more groups where the policy applies. When members of a group where the policy is applied attempt to sign in, access applications, or read secrets, the policy conditions are evaluated to determine whether the user should be allowed access, allowed access with multifactor authentication of denied access. Create a unified policy You must be assigned the Super Admin or Org Admin role to define unified policies. To create a unified policy: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Policies . Click Add Policy . Type a descriptive name for the new unified policy that indicates the purpose or scope of the policy. Select the groups where the policy should apply. All of the members of the groups you select are subject to the policy controls. For example, select All User to apply this policy to all users with access to Splashtop Secure Workspace. (Optional) Specify specify one or more tags to categorize the policy for filtering and searching. Click Add Control , then select the type of control you want to enforce with this policy. Select Secret Read to control read access to secrets. Select Secret Write to control write access to secrets. Select Secret Admin to control administrative permissions for secrets. Select Application Access to control access to applications. Select User Authentication to control authentication request handling. Select Network Access to control access to network resources. For each control, you can specify a default action to take if none of the conditions you specify is met. If you aren't defining any conditions, you should select Allow to allow access or Allow_MFA to allow access with multifactor authentication. If you have previously defined conditions, you can select the condition to evaluate and the action to take based on the result of the evaluation. To define a condition for the control you're adding, click Choose conditions , select Create new condition , then follow the steps in Create a new condition .

You can also choose to use networks to group connectors based on whatever criteria best reflects your organization. After you identify where you need to deploy connectors to provide access to applications, you have a few different options for how you deploy them. The two primary options are: Deploy directly from an application running locally on a macOS, Windows, or Linux computer using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client app. Deploy indirectly from a remote repository using a deployment and orchestration service like Docker or Kubernetes and Helm. Deploying directly from the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client is the simplest option because you can use a familiar graphical user interface to download, install, and run the software. Deploying from a remote repository requires you to run a fairly complex command in a terminal shell. However, you can use the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal to construct the command for the platform you use. If you choose to deploy from the command line, you can also automate the process using scripts and other deployment tools. You have three options for deploying from the command line: Docker Helm Linux The specific commands you use are different, but the steps are the same for all three of these deployment options: You select the headless command-line interface option to indicate that you want to perform a service-based deployment. You configure the connector settings that are used to construct the correct command line. You configure application discovery settings for the connector to find applications on your network.

There are a few different ways you can add applications to the Splashtop Secure Workspace network. For example, you can add applications directly from computers where you have installed the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client or remotely from the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Discover applications in the test network In most cases, you can discover applications automatically by running a connector on an internal network and allowing the connector to scan for one or more of the following connection protocols: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS). Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Virtual Network Connection (VNC). Splashtop Desktop Protocol (SDP). Secure Shell (SSH). Kubernetes client API. Telnet protocol. Each time you add a connector, you also configure its application discovery settings. The application discovery settings specify: How frequently the connector scans the network for applications. The application protocols you want to discover on the network. After applications are discovered, you can choose which applications you want to manage access to and add those applications to Splashtop Secure Workspace. It's important to note that you must add the applications you want to manage to Splashtop Secure Workspace. Discovered applications are automatically visible in the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. However, you must add applications before you can set group entitlements and assign access policies to them. Add applications from the desktop client In Deploy connectors in a test network , you deployed connectors on two macOS computers using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client. Those two connectors should still be running\u2014with the Connected status\u2014under your administrative account. You're now going to use the connector in the desktop client application to discover local applications on the macOS computers. To add discovered applications using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client: Open Secure Workspace running locally on the macOS computer. If you closed the application, sign back in and run the connector to re-establish your connection to the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge. Click Connector to verify the status is Connected. Click Discover applications . If you enabled screen sharing and remote login as described in Prepare for evaluation , you should see two local applications discovered. Click Select All to add both applications, then click Add . Repeat these steps for the second macOS computer. Add applications from the administrative portal Adding applications directly from a computer where the desktop client is installed is simple, but less common than adding applications from the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Note that you must add the applications discovered by connectors to the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal before you can create and manage application access policies. If you've already adding discovered applications from macOS computers using the desktop client, you can use the following steps to add discovered applications from the Linux computers. To add discovered applications to the administrative portal: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Applications , then click Applications . Click Add Applications , then select Add Discovered Applications . The administrative portal displays all of the applications that have been discovered by the connectors in the network. For example, you'll see the applications discovered on the computers where the connector is running as a Linux service in the background. Select the checkbox for the application you want to add and select a group and access type for the application. The All User and Organization Admin groups are default groups for accounts that are assigned either the User role or the Org Admin role. You can select one of these groups or the built-in Anonymous group for each application. You haven't added any policies yet, so you can leave that field empty for now. For the Access Type, you can select All to allow any type of access, Network to allow access using a network-based client, or Browser to allow access from a browser. Click Add to add the selected application to the Splashtop Secure Workspace application catalog. Add a private application manually In addition to discovered applications, you can use the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal to add private applications and resources manually. For example, you can add printers or smart appliances to your network to simplify access and remote management of those devices. Adding applications manually to Splashtop Secure Workspace requires you to provide information about how users access the application, including the access method, the application protocol, and the host name or IP address that users connect to. All of this information is highly dependent on the type of application or resource you're adding. Therefore, the following instructions provide a simplified example that you can use as a general model. To add a private application: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Open Applications , then click Applications . Click Add Applications , then select Add Private Application . Type the Application name and the Display name to use for the application. Select the type of access that can be used to connect to the application: Select All to allow any type of access. Select Network to allow access over a private network using a network-based client. Select Browser to allow access to the application from a browser. Select the protocol used to connect to the application or resource. Regardless of the protocol you select, you must provide at least the following information: Application host by hostname or IP address. Port number used to access the application. Splashtop Secure Workspace connector or the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge location to use for the application. For the evaluation, we're going to add a shared printer, so select CUSTOM . Specify the hostname or IP address and the port number. For example, if you are adding a shared printer as a resource that you want to manage access to, you can specify an address similar to the following: 192.168.1.101:631 Select Through Connector and select the connector to use to access the printer address in the private local area network (LAN). Select All Users as the group. Click Save to save the application. Add a public application Public applications are applications that you access over the internet using a public endpoint URL. Adding public applications to Splashtop Secure Workspace requires you to provide information about how users sign in to use the application, including the authentication protocol, the service provider's endpoint URL, and the identity providers that can be used to authenticate the user signing in. All of this information is highly dependent on the public application service provider. To add a public application: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Applications , then click Applications . Click Add Applications , then select Add Public Application . For the General Settings, provide the following information: Type the Application name . Type the Display name to use for the application. Select an Icon to use for the application. The rest of the information you must provide is highly dependent on the public application service provider. The instructions in the following sections provide a simplified example that you can use as a general model. Set sign-on options Set group and policy options Set identity provider options Export and import applications After you add a public or private application to Splashtop Secure Workspace, you can export its configuration information to a JSON file. By exporting the application configuration to a JSON file, you can keep the JSON file as a digital snapshot of a working application's settings. You can export the configuration for multiple public or private applications in the same JSON file. However, you can't include both public and private applications in the same JSON file. After you export the configuration for an application, you can import the JSON file to restore an application if something goes wrong, add an application to another organization, replicate an application on another network, or modify application settings to reuse the configuration in a different context. Export application information To export an application to a configuration file: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Applications , then click Applications . Select the checkbox for one or more applications, then click More and select the appropriate export option. For example, select a private application, click More , then select Export Private Application . By default, the JSON configuration file is generated and placed in your Downloads folder. You can open and edit this file in a text editor. For example, you might want to modify the application name if you plan to import the application in the same organization you exported it from. Import an application To import an application from a configuration file: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Applications , then click Applications . Click Import and select the appropriate import option. For example, click Import , then select Import Private Application . Drag and drop the JSON file for the application you want to import into the Upload section. Select one or more applications included in the JSON file to import. Select an edge location or a connector, then click Import . Open an application After you add applications to the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal, you can open them remotely from the portal to test access. For example, if the computers in the test network have sharing and remote login enabled, you can use the VNC or OpenSSH client to verify access. To test access to your discovered applications: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Applications , then click Applications . Click the OpenSSH application icon or display name for a computer in your test network. For example, try starting the OpenSSH client that runs on Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server. In this test network, the Ubuntu Server has the IP address 10.0.2.15 and is named ajuba0 . Type a valid Username and Password for an account, then click Sign in . Verify you have signed in using OpenSSH on the remote computer. For example: You can also test access to applications using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client. You see that in the next section. Next steps Now that you have some applications in the test network, you can start configuring entitlements and policies to control who has access and under what conditions. In Add users, groups, and policies , you'll learn how to add test users and groups to your organization and how to configure a basic access policy.","title":"Add applications"},{"location":"evaluation/add-eval-applications/#discover-applications-in-the-test-network","text":"In most cases, you can discover applications automatically by running a connector on an internal network and allowing the connector to scan for one or more of the following connection protocols: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).

So far, you've performed tasks using only your own administrative account, but to really see Splashtop Secure Workspace in action, you need to prepare a few additional accounts for testing purposes. Add users Users in your organization each need to have their own Splashtop Secure Workspace account. There are a few different ways you can add users to your organization. For example, you can add users: By adding account information for one user at a time. By importing account information from an external identity provider like Google Workplace, Azure Active Directory, Okta, or GitHub. By preparing accounts for multiple users and sending email invitations. Prepare an email invitation For simplicity and the purposes of evaluation, let\u2019s send email invitations to test that method for adding new user accounts to the organization. To invite users: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Users . Click Invite Users . Type the email address for the first test user account. If you want to add more than one user with the same settings, click the plus sign (+) and type another email address. Select Vault unlocks automatically on log in . Select a Role for the test account. You should select the User role for at least one email address to add an account for a user with no special permissions. If you have multiple email addresses available for testing, you might want to assign other roles to those addresses. For information about different roles, see Oragnizations and roles . Click Invite to send the email invitation. Activate the new account To activate the new user account: Check the inbox for the email invitation and open it. Click Get started then follow the steps to set up the new user account. Notice that the portal displays the applications you added previously, but the portal doesn't include any of the administrative sections in the navigation. You can open applications from the portal just like did from the administrative portal. Click your user progile, then select Logout . Sign in with the new account You now have two accounts\u2014the organization administrative account and a basic user account\u2014for you to test different scenarios. For example, you can use the account you just assigned the User role to access an application using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client application. To sign in using the new account: Open Secure Workspace on the macOS computer in the test network. Click Log out , then click Sign out . Type the test user account name and password, then click Sign in . Click Download PDF to save the recovery codes for the test account. Specify a location and file name, then click Save . After you save your recovery codes, the portal displays the applications that have been added to Splashtop Secure Workspace. Click Open Browser for the Apple remote desktop VNC client on the other macOS computer. Provide the credentials for the test user account to open the remote desktop on the target macOS computer. After you verify access, you can close the browser tab or window to disconnect from the remote computer. Add groups Groups allow you to authorize different set of users to access different applications or meet different criteria. You've already seen that there two default general purpose groups for all users and all organization administrators. Groups provided entitlements to their members and can be associated with policies to give you fine-grained control over the conditions you configure. For example, you can create separate groups for students and instructors then define different rules to apply to each group. To add a new group: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Groups . Click Add Groups . Type a new group name\u2014for example, create a new group called staff and, optionally, type a display name, and a description for the group. Click Save to add the new group to the list of groups. Click Assign new members . Click Assign next to the test account to add that user to the staff group. Add a unified policy With a unified policy, you can combine different types of access controls and conditions to evaluate in a single policy definition. However, this flexibility can lead to complexity. In general, it's best to start with a few simple controls and build more sophisticated policies over time. To create a unified policy: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Policies . Click Add Policy . Type a name for the new unified policy\u2014for example, create a new policy called Simple authentication \u2014and select All User to apply this policy to all users with access to Splashtop Secure Workspace. Click Add Control , then select User Authentication . By selecting User Authentication, you are specifying that you want to trigger the policy to be evaluation when anyone in the All User group attempts to sign in using Splashtop Secure Workspace. By default, the policy is set to deny access if none of the conditions you specify are met. To keep this policy simple, you can change the default action to Allow_MFA and remove the condition from the policy by clicking the minus (-) next to the first condition. If you save this setting, all users will be required to use multifactor authentication every time they sign in. You'll also be signed out of the administrative portal and need to enable multifactor authentication to sign back in. This policy might be appropriate for some organizations, but let's assume we want it to be a bit more lenient. To do that, we need to add conditions to the policy. Click Save to save the policy as-is for now, then click the Enabled toggle to turn enforcement of the policy off. Add conditions One problem with setting up a unified policy is that there are default actions for each type of control, there aren't any default conditions to check. So although it's simple to require all users to sign in with multifactor authentication, it's more likely that you would only want to require that under specific conditions. That's where adding conditions that you can use in unified policies comes into play. To add a new condition: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Conditions . Click Add Condition . Type a name for the new condition\u2014for example, create a new condition called Allowed countries . For this example, let's assume the organization has operations in the United Stated, Germany, and the United Kingdom, so we create condition for these three countries. We can then use the conditions in a policy to allow authentication requests coming from those countries to be allowed by default. Verify the default Condition Type Authentication and Authorization is selected. Depending on the type of information you want to use to allow or deny access, you can select a different condition type. For example, with the DNS condition type, you can allow or deny access based on domain names, like nra.org, or content categories, such as sports or video gaming. For the condition we want to use in the Simple authentication unified policy, the Authentication and Authorization condition type is the most appropriate. Click Add Condition , then select Location (Country) . Select United States , click plus (+) and select Germany , then click plus and select United Kingdom . Click Save . Now that you have a condition, you can use it in a unified policy. You can also create additional conditions to restrict access to specific days of the week, hours of the day, or network IP addresses. Use a condition in a policy Now let's use the Allowed countries condition in the Simple authentication policy. To use conditions in a unified policy: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Access , then click Policies . Click Edit next to the Simple authentication policy. Click plus (+), then select the Allowed countries condition, True , and Allow . Click Save . Click the Enabled toggle to turn enforcement of the policy on. With this policy, any authentication requests coming for the United States, Germany, or the United Kingdom won't require multifactor authentication. Requests coming from any other country will require multifactor authentication. You can add additional conditions to the authentication control or add additional controls to the policy. For example, you might want to add a separate condition to deny all authentication requests from specific countries or to add an Application Access control that restricts who can access applications. Next steps Now that you've seen how to add a simple unified policy for authentication requests, you're ready to explore how to define and use more complex application access policies.

The next step in the evaluation is to deploy Splashtop Secure Workspace connectors to enable the computers in the test network to connect to the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge. For this evaluation, you are going to do the following: Create a new network identifier for this group of computers. Download and install a Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client app on each macOS computer. You can follow similar steps to download and install the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client on any macOS, Linux, or Windows computer that hosts applications in your private network. Download and run the Splashtop Secure Workspace connector from the Linux command line. You can follow similar steps to download and run the Splashtop Secure Workspace connector using Docker, Helm, or any distribution of Linux. Add a network identifier By default, your organization provides the top-level of your network infrastructure. However, a top-heavy structure can be inconvenient to manage if you have multiple locations, departments, or business units that host applications. Network identifiers allow you to group connectors into logical units. For example, if you have three branch offices, you might want to use networks to identify the connectors associated with each office location. To add a network identifier: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector to display the connectors currently deployed for your organization. Click Network to see the networks you have currently defined. For the test network in this evaluation, there's only one\u2014the current organization\u2014and in this example the organization is named ajuba-acme . Click Add Network to add a new network identifier to your organization. Type a Network Name that makes it easy to identify what the network represents. For example, if the connectors in this network are in a specific geographical region, you can use the network name to identify the region. For the network in this evaluation, the new network name ajuba-california . (Optional) Add one or more Tags for searching and filtering networks. For the network in this evaluation, add the tags la , sf , sd , and ssh . (Optional) Type a Description to provide any additional information about the connectors in this network. For the network in this evaluation, add the description Test network for evaluators . Click Save . Deploy a connector using the desktop client There are two primary connector deployment options: You can deploy a connector directly from a desktop client application running locally on a macOS, Windows, or Linux computer. You can deploy a connector from a remote repository using a command-line script or a service like Docker or Helm. Deploying directly from the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client is the simplest option because you can use a familiar graphical user interface to download, install, and run the software. Let's do that now to install the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client on the macOS computers in the test network. Download and install software To download and install the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client on a local computer: On the macOS computer with the Intel chip, sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector to display the list of connectors in your organization. Click Add connector . Select With the SSW Desktop App , then click Next . Click Mac and Intel Chip . Click the first step to download the connector for the operating system and architecture you selected. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions to install the software. Run the connector After you install the desktop client application on the local computer, you can use the local desktop client to run the connector. To run the connector: Open Secure Workspace on the computer where your installed the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client, then click Next step . For example, on the macOS computer, go to Applications and open Secure Workspace . Select the name of your organization from the list of recent organizations, then click Launch . Type the Username and Password your administrative account, then click Sign in . Click Connector in the sidebar. By default, the connector location is prepopulated using the point of presence closest to your current location. Select Allow Remote Control if you want to manage the connector from the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Application Discovery if you want to customize the settings used to discover applications such as the scan interval, IP address range, or protocols to look for. Click Run Connector to connect to the Splashtop Secure Workspace network edge. After the connection is made, you should see the connector status is Connected. You can click Discover applications to find local applications immediately after the connector status changes to Connected. However, this step is covered in more defail in Add applications so you can focus on getting the test network up and running. Deploy a second connector Repeat the steps in the previous sections to deploy a connector on the macOS computer with the Apple silicon chip. To install the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client on the second macOS computer: On the macOS computer with the Intel chip, sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector to display the list of connectors in your organization. Click Add connector . Select With the SSW Desktop App , then click Next . Select Mac and Apple Silicon to download the desktop client. Download and install the desktop client. Open the Secure Workspace application. Click Connector , then click Run Connector . Deploy a connector using the command line Deploying a connector from a remote repository requires you to run a fairly complex command in a terminal shell. However, you can use the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal to construct the command for the platform you use. If you choose to deploy from the command line, you can also automate the process using scripts and other deployment tools. To illustrate how to deploy a connector from a remote repository, let's use a script from the Linux command line. Configure connector settings To add a connector by running a script in a terminal: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector to display the connectors currently deployed for your organization. Click Add Connector . Click Headless / CLI , then click Next . Configure the settings for the connector and application discovery, then click Next . For this Do this Connector name Type a name for the connector process to use. You should avoid including spaces or special characters. Display name Type the name you want displayed in the administrative portal for the connector. Network Verify the network displayed is the correct organization. Optionally, you can add a new network identifier for the connector instead of using your organization. For more information about adding networks, see Add a network identifier . Edge location Select an appropriate edge location. Auto bandwidth detection Select this option to allow the connector to monitor bandwidth changes to ensure the best performance for the connector. Cluster mode Select this option if you want to install the connector on multiple nodes to form a cluster. For example, you can select this option to add and deploy multiple instances of the connector to make your network more resilient and to prevent service interruptions. Scan interval Set the frequency for the connector to check for changes to the applications. In most cases, the default interval of 20 minutes is appropriate. IP range Set an IP range for discovering applications, if appropriate. You can use the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) format\u2014for example, 192.168.20.0/24\u2014to specify the range. Alternatively, you can specify a static IP address or a range of addresses using the following format: 192.168.20.0-192.168.20.100 Protocols Click Select all to scan for all application protocols. Select Linux as the deployment method. You should see a command line that looks similar to the following example, but with a full token instead of the truncated token shown here: export SSW_CONNECTOR=connector-acme-ajubaacm-ajubacolfax && \\ curl -fsSL \"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/splashlock-assets.splashshield.ai/connector/stage/setup.sh\" | sudo bash -s $SSW_CONNECTOR && \\ sudo $SSW_CONNECTOR -install -configPath /etc/$SSW_CONNECTOR \\ -conf [token removed] && sudo systemctl start $SSW_CONNECTOR If you are deploying on a cluster, click Add Instance to automatically construct the command line for each additional instance. A number is appended to the connector name for each instance you add. For example, if you set the the connector name to sanfrancisco , the first instance is named sanfrancisco1 , the second instance is named sanfrancisco2 , and so on. Copy the command displayed and leave the deployment page open in the administrative portal. Install the connector To install the connector from the command line: Open a terminal shell on the Linux computer. Verify that you have sudo permission by running the following command: sudo --list Paste the command you copied from the administrative portal. The command line sets an environment variable, downloads the connector setup script, executes the setup script using the environment variable, and starts the connector. Between downloading the script and executing it, you might be prompted to provide your password to run the command using your sudo privileges. After running the command, return to the administrative portal deployment page to verify the status of the connector is Connected. Click Done . View connector status If you completed the steps in the previous sections, you now have a small test network to try out the evaluation scenarios. To view the status of your network: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector to display the connectors currently deployed for your organization. Verify your connectors are running. For example, the test network for the Evaluator's handbook consists of two macOS computers and two Linux virtual machines: Change the information displayed By default, the connectors list displays the following details about each connector: Connector name Connector display name Splashtop Secure Workspace edge location Network name Current status of Connected, Disconnected, or Unknown Deployment type Private IP address for the connector Public IP address for the connector Date the connector was deployed User who deployed the connector Date the connector was last modified User who last modified the connector To change the columns displayed: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Deployment , then click Connector . Click Settings in the Actions column. Clear the checkbox for any column you want to hide. Select the checkbox for each column you want to show.

You saw the first method in Manage secrets when you assigned the permissions defined in a secrets policy to a user or group. If you are the owner of a secret\u2014or of a folder that contains multiple secrets\u2014you can assign specific permissions to individual users or groups in your organization. With this type of sharing, you can use the Details tab to share secrets with specific users or group, select the security policy to apply, and the specific read, write, or admin permission to grant for each user and group you are sharing secrets with. The second way you can share secret information is called link sharing . With link sharing, you to share individual secrets with third parties or contractors who don't have a Splashtop Secure Workspace account. As the owner of a secret, you can generate a link and send it to the recipient. The recipient can then use the link to access and view the shared secret or store it in their own personal vault or Splashtop Secure Workspace. To create a link for a secret: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Under Secrets Manager, click Secrets , then click the vault name\u2014either My Vault or ajuba \u2014to display the secrets list. Find the specific secret that you want to share with an external party. Select Link Share from the list of Actions for the secret. Specify a title, the number of times the link was be used, allowed usage, and an expiration date. You can also add an optional passphrase to secure the shared secret, so that only authorized individuals can access the shared secret. The optional passphrase provides an additional layer of protection against unauthorized access. Click Create . Copy the link to your clipboard, then click OK . Send the link to the authorized external party. One of the most common use cases for link sharing is to give an external party temporary administrative access or privilege elevation for a specific resource or application.","title":"Grant temporary privileged access"},{"location":"evaluation/manage-multiple-organizations/","text":"In Splashtop Secure Workspace, an organization represents the top-level entity with resources\u2014like applications and servers\u2014that you manage access to and security for. For example, an organization might be a global business, a school district, or a regional government agency. However, organizations aren't defined by their size. Organization are defined by the scope of what they contain. Each organization is an independent entity with its own users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies. For example, an enterprise with multiple divisions might have separate organizations for engineering and sales because engineering and sales have very different sets of users and applications to manage and because they share very little infrastructure. It's important to keep this separation in mind because each organization is managed completely independent from all other organizations. Users in one organization don't have access to resources in any other organization. If you have an account that's assigned the Org Admin role, the separation between organizations is transparent because you only ever see the users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies for your own organization. However, if you have an account that's assigned the Super Admin role, you can create and manage multiple organizations. If you manage multiple organizations, it's important to keep your current context in mind. After you select the organization you want to work with, every task you perform in the administrative portal is specific to the organization you selected. Create a new organization The Super Admin role is typically used by third-party service providers who manage independent network infrastructures for multiple clients. Beyond the service provider use case, few organizations need the Super Admin role or the ability to create an manage new organizations. If you have an account that's been assigned the Super Admin role, your first step is create one or more organizations. To create a new organization: Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account. Click Access , then click Organizations . Click Add Organization . Type the name of the new organization. The organization identifier is generated automatically from the name you specify and the name of the cloud instance that hosts the organization. (Optional) Type additional information about the organization in the Description field. Click Save . Change the current organization If you manage more than one organization, you can change from one organization to another by opening the list of organization, and then selecting the organization you want to work with. For example: After you select a new organization, all of your actions only affect the users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies in that organization. For example, you can invite users and add groups to the new organization. Next steps After you have created at least one organization, you can begin deploying the network infrastructure and preparing access to applications.

Secret information\u2014like passwords, private keys, and personal identifying information\u2014is stored in a vault . A vault is a secure and isolated space for encrypted data. Secrets stored in the vault use zero-knowledge encryption to ensure that your data is stored in an encrypted format that can only be decrypted on the client side by you as the owner of the private key. Splashtop Secure Workspace components don't have access to your keys and can't decrypt any secret content you store. What you can store as secret information You can store many different types of private or confidential information as secrets in a Splashtop Secure Workspace vault. For example, you can use the vault to securely store the following information: Passwords Secure shell (SSH) keys API keys Sensitive notes Personal identification cards After storing secret information in the vault, you can easily use and share credentials without exposing the secret information itself. For example, you can prepare dynamic credentials that autofill passwords for access to applications and websites to streamline the user experience. Personal and organization-level vaults In Splashtop Secure Workspace, secrets are stored and managed in either a personal vault named My Vault or an organization-level vault named with the organization name. By using two secret vaults, Splashtop Secure Workspace ensures that sensitive information remains protected for both individual users and the organization and secret information can only be accessed by authorized individuals. Personal vault Each Splashtop Secure Workspace user has a unique personal password vault for secret information. Only the individual user who possesses the master password and the private key can access the secrets stored in the personal vault. By providing My Vault,Splashtop Secure Workspace ensures that users have the utmost privacy and control over their own secret information. If other users share secrets with you, those secrets are also included in your personal My Vault. Organization-level vault The vault for an organization has the same name as the organization it holds secret information for. For example, the organization name ajuba also has a vault for secret information named ajuba . Organization-level vaults are owned by users who are assigned the Org Admin or Super Admin role. Organization vaults serve as shared repositories of secrets within the organization. Most users don't have access to their organization's secret vault. However, administrators can create and share secrets in the organization vault and share those secrets from the organization vault with specific groups or users. When you share secrets from the organization vault with other users in the organization, they are added to each of those user's My Vault, ensuring easy access and centralized management. Add a secret As an organization administrator, you are most often going to add secret information to the organization vault so you can share it with authorized accounts when necessary. In this test network, the organization name is ajuba , so ajuba is the vault that contains secret information for the organization. To add secret information to the vault: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Under Secrets Manager, click Secrets , then click the organization vault name\u2014in this example, ajuba \u2014to display the empty policies list. If you want to add secret information to your personal vault instead of the organization's vault, click My Vault . Click Add Item . Select the type of secret inforamtion you want to add to the vault. For this example, you are going to add a secret for accessing a discovered application, so click Zero Trust Application from the Secrets category. Secrets: Website One-Time Passcode Application API Key Zero Trust Application Splashtop Remote Computer Commonly Used: SSH Key Note Bookmark Personal Info: Name Email Phone Address Company Website Payments: Bank Accounts Credit Card IDs: ID Card Social Security Number Driver's License Passport Tax Number Select an application from the list of applications that have been added to Splashtop Secure Workspace. For example, select an OpenSSH client running on Ubuntu Server. Type a unique name for identifying this secret. Select the Type of authentication for this secret. After you select an authentication type, the information you must provide changes to reflect that type. For simplicity in this example, select Password . After you select Password, type a user name and password for access to the application. You can also add an optional note about this secret. Click Save to save the secret in the vault. Organizing secrets You can use folders to organize secrets in your personal or organization vault. Folders can make it easier to categorize, manage, and share secret information with others inside or outside of your organization. You can also nest folders to create a logical hierarchical structure for related information. To add a folder for organizing secrets: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Under Secrets Manager, click Secrets , then click the vault name\u2014either My Vault or ajuba \u2014to display the secrets list. Click Add Folder . Type a name for the folder, then click the checkmark to save it. After you create a folder, you can click the folder name to open it, Insider the new folder: Click Add Item to add new secrets to it. Click Add Folder to create another interior folder. If you have existing secrets that belong in the new folder, select Move from the list of Actions for that secret. You can then select the new location of the secret and click Move . Create a policy for secret information After you add one or more secrets to a vault, you can use policies to set conditions that control when, how, or where secret information can be used. Much like application policies, there are two ways you can control access to secrets: By adding a secret read, write, or permission control to a unified policy. By creating and assigning a read, write, or permission policy to a specific secret or group of secrets. If you add secret controls to a unified policy, they are applied globally to all secrets. The global policies can't be assigned to specific secrets. Therefore, it's often more practical to create policies that you plan to assign to individual secrets or a folder with a specific set of secrets. To create and assign a policy to a secret: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Under Secrets Manager, click Policies to display the empty policies list. Click Add New . Type a unique policy name. Click Add Control , then select the type of control you want to add: Select Secret Read to specify the conditions to evaluate if there's an attempt to read a secret where this policy is applied. Select Secret Write to specify the conditions to evaluate if a new secret is being created or an existing secret modified in a folder or vault where this policy is applied. Select Secret Permission to specify the conditions to evaluate if there's an update to the permissions associated with a secret where this policy is applied. You can create separate policies for each control or combine them in a single policy. By default, the Date and Time condition is added when you select a control. You can click Delete to remove this condition from the control. For example, if you want to use the location or network IP address to determine whether a secret can be read, delete the default Data and Time condition. For this sample secrets policy, click Delete to remove the Date and TIme condition. Select the Default Action for the control. In most cases, you should select Deny if you are defining conditions for allowing access. If you are defining conditions for denying access, you can select Allow or Allow_MFA as the default action. For this sample secrets policy, leave Deny as the default action. Click Add Condition , then select the type of condition you want to add, such as Date and Time, Location, Network, Browser, Extension, or OS. For this sample secrets policy, select Network as the type of condition. Specify the conditions to evaluate for the selected condition type. For example, specify the timezone, days, and hours for the Date and Time condition, or the list of countries for the Location condition. For this sample secrets policy, specify an IP address range in CIDR format\u2014for example, 192.168.0.0/24 \u2014as the condition. Select the action if for the condition is met. For this sample secrets policy, select Allow as the type of condition. Add conditions and controls to the policy, as needed, then click Save . Now that yu have a policy, you can assign it to a secret.

However, the Quick start doesn't represent a typical deployment. To prepare for an evaluation that allows you to simulate your network infrastructure and test different types of access and device policies, you must have a physical or virtual network with representative servers, applications, and endpoints. Therefore, for the purposes of evaluation, the Evaluator's Handbook assumes you have access to a small test environment and that you have administrative privileges for managing the test network. Review the architecture You can get an overview of Splashtop Secure Workspace features and architecture in the following articles: What is Splashtop Secure Workspace? Basic concepts and component Organizations and roles At a minimum, you should be familiar with the following Splashtop Secure Workspace core components: The Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client app The Splashtop Secure Workspace cloud service The Splashtop Secure Workspace network edge services Splashtop Secure Workspace connectors Set up a test network You can use any method you like to set up the test network. For example, you can use virtualization software to create a network of virtual Linux, macOS, and Windows virtual machines. If you have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account, you can create a virtual network using an AWS instance. If you have experience with Kubernetes, you can create the test network in a Kubernetes cluster. The simplest way to set up a test network is to deploy connectors on a few representative servers that host applications and that are configured to allow communication within your firewall. For the evaluation scenarios described in this guide, the Evaluator's handbook assumes that the evaluation test environment consists of the following physical or virtual machines: Two macOS computers One Ubuntu Server One Ubuntu Desktop Set up accounts The evaluation scenarios in this guide assume that you have access to at least two accounts\u2014an administrative account and a regular user account\u2014for testing purposes. You also might want to set up a test account for any external applications that you want to include in your own evaluation scenarios. If your evaluation includes testing access to cloud-based applications or applications that are hosted on the public internet, you should collect information about how the external service provider handles authentication and authorization for user account. For example, you should know whether the service provider requires users to create a user name and password or sign in with an email address. Verify applications are available If you have a virtual or physical network prepared for testing purposes, be sure the network includes representative applications that use one or more of the following standard connection protocols to support remote access: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Virtual Network Connection (VNC) Splashtop Desktop Protocol (SDP) Secure Shell (SSH) or telnet Kubernetes client API After you identify the computers in your test network that host applications that use these access protocols, you should take note of the host name, IP addresses, and ports numbers used. Verify remote access is allowed You should also verify that the applications and computers in the test environment are configured to allow remote access or network sharing. For example, on the macOS computers in the evaluation environment, you should turn on the following system settings: Screen sharing Printer sharing Remote login Similarly, you should check that the computers you include in the test network allow remote access and host applications that you want to test access to. For example, if you include Ubuntu Desktop be sure that sharing is on and active.

Click Edit next to the Simple authentication policy. Click Add Control , then select Application Access . Leave the default action to Deny access Select the Allowed countries condition, True , and Allow . Click Save . With this policy, only authenticated users requesting access to applications from within an allowed location are granted access. All other users are denied access to applications in the organization. Add an application policy If you want finer grain control over application access, you might want to define application-specific access policies in addition to or as a replacement for application access controls in unified policies. Unlike unified policies, you can create conditions directly in application policies. To add an application policy: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal. Click Applications , then click Policies to display the application policies list. Click Add Policy . Type a name for the new application policy\u2014for example, create a new policy called Restricted access \u2014and select All User to apply this policy to all users with access to Splashtop Secure Workspace. Click Add Condition , then select Date and Time . Select Allow_MFA as the default action. If no conditions are met, user must provide multifactor authentication to access to application. Select a Timezone for evaluating the time of day associated with the access request. For example, select UTC-08:00 | UTC-07:00 to select Pacific Daylight | Pacific Standard Time. Set a start time and an end time for the policy to be in effect. For example, select a start time of 06:00 and an end time of 18:00 to have the policy in effect from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Select the days of the week for the policy to be in effect. For example, select Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday to set the standard working days. If you want to add aany additional conditions, you can click Add Condition and select another condition type. For example, if this policy only applies when application access requests originate in the United States, you can select Location and then select United States. Select Allow to allow users to access applications without multifactor authentication during the specified hours and days. Click Save to save your new application policy. Now that you have an application policy, you can assign it to an application. To assign the new policy to an application: Sign in with your administrative account to open the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal.

The following diagram illustrates this simplified view with connectors for applications hosted in three locations\u2014headquarters (HQ), branch offices, and the cloud\u2014sending network traffic to the Splashtop Secure Workspace network edge service. The Splashtop Secure Workspace network edge is responsible for receiving and routing network traffic. All of the configuration, evaluation, and orchestration is handled by the Splashtop Secure Workspace cloud. This diagram is useful in explaining the basic flow from a user or device requesting access and how the request is routed through the Splashtop Secure Workspace cloud and edge services to the applications hosted in different network locations. However, a closer look at the architecture can give you better insight into what you are deploying and how the components work together. Splashtop Secure Workspace clients Computers and mobile devices are the endpoints that enable remote users to connect to the applications they need to use. However, Splashtop Secure Workspace doesn't require every endpoint device to have client software installed. Instead, Splashtop Secure Workspace provides flexibility for how users access their applications. For example, Splashtop Secure Workspace provides the following options: Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal. The most common way to access applications through Splashtop Secure Workspace is the Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal. As long as an endpoint has a browser, nothing needs to be installed on the endpoint to use the Splashtop Secure Workspace portal. There are also browser extensions available for the most common browsers to provide convenience features that enhance the user experience. Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop clients. Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop clients are typically installed on computers that host internal applications and that can only accessed on an internal network. If an application can't be accessed through a browser, it requires a desktop client to be installed on the computers that host the application. Splashtop Secure Workspace mobile clients. Splashtop Secure Workspace mobile clients enable users to securely access their applications from mobile devices. Splashtop Secure Workspace command-line interface (CLI) client. The Splashtop Secure Workspace CLI client enables developers to take action programmatically. Each Splashtop Secure Workspace client offers slightly different features, so you might select different deployment options depending on the application context or the specific features you want to use. For example, if there are computers that must run application sessions outside of a browser, you would install the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client on those computers. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between endpoints and the Splashtop Secure Workspace clients. Computers Computers are typically laptop and desktop computers. Organizations can require computers to be configured to meet certain security standards. For example, you can require computers to use disk encryption, have anti-virus software installed, or run a required process. Splashtop Secure Workspace checks that computers meet the requirements you specify before allowing users to connect and, optionally, at intervals while the user is connected to ensure that the device continues to meet the requirements. Splashtop Secure Workspace supports macOS, Windows, and Linux computers that connect using the Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal, desktop client, or CLI client. Mobile devices Mobile devices are typically smartphones or tablets. Splashtop Secure Workspace supports phones and tablets with iOS and Android operating systems. Mobile devices can connect to Splashtop Secure Workspace using the Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal or mobile client. Cloud-based services Splashtop Secure Workspace is a cloud-native platform that uses cloud-based resources to provide its services including: Wide-area network (WAN) capabilities. Computing capacity. Data storage. Software-defined topology. The Splashtop Secure Workspace platform provides two types of cloud-based services. You can think of them as the control plane and the data plane or as the orchestration layer and the networking layer. The control plane, or Splashtop Secure Workspace orchestration layer, manages and controls many Splashtop Secure Workspace operations and behaviors. For example, it authenticates access requests and applies the rules you define for users, network connections, devices, and applications. All of the administrative tasks that enable you to secure your organization are managed through the orchestration layer of the platform. The data plane, or networking layer is called the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge because it handles the gateway connections and network routing for users connecting to and interacting with applications. The Splashtop Secure Workspace edge takes its instructions from the control plane to provide secure network connections from geographically diverse locations. Cloud control plane and orchestration services Splashtop Secure Workspace allows you configure, manage, and control a lot of information about your organization and the security measure you want to enforce. In most cases, you perform these tasks using the services presented in the Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal for administrators. Configuration services Through the control plane, you can configure and manage the following configuration-related services: Service What it does Network manager Maps a virtual network in the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge for each organization. Application manager Handles access to applications for users and manages connections for all of an organization\u2019s enrolled applications. Device manager Defines and manages device profiles for the user devices running Splashtop Secure Workspace clients. It also checks whether Splashtop Secure Workspace connected devices meet your organization's minimum security requirements. Secrets manager Stores user credentials and other secrets. It also generates passwords, checks password health, and handles secret sharing. Observability manager Records Splashtop Secure Workspace events and works with application session recordings and audit trails. Policy engine Defines, manages, and applies policies that control users' access to Splashtop Secure Workspace and to an organization\u2019s applications. The policy engine also distributes tokens to authenticated clients. The tokens allow users to connect to the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge service and to use specific Splashtop Secure Workspace features after they are connected. Data storage The information you configure is stored in the following locations: Data store What it does Vault Stores data for the secrets manager using zero-knowledge encryption. Zero-knowledge encryption ensures that only the private key owner\u2014and no components of the Splashtop Secure workspace service\u2014can access secured data. Audit trail Stores events captured by Splashtop Secure Workspace for each user\u2019s activity within an application session. Session recording Stores the video recording of an application session if recording is requested. Configuration Stores Splashtop Secure Workspace parameters, settings, and other administrative information. The location where data is stored is important in some jurisdictions. For example, European Union nations require data to be stored in EU locations. With Splashtop Secure Workspace, you can use public or private cloud locations to set up customer data stores in different geographical region if you need to satisfy these types of data storage requirements Identity services You use identity services to set up and manage user accounts and groups. Identity services also play a central role in user authentication. Through the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal, you can configure and manage the following identity-related services: Service What it does Identity and access management (IAM) Sets authentication rules and controls the other identity services. Identity provider (IDP) Creates and manages Splashtop Secure Workspace user accounts along with each account\u2019s authentication secrets. Identity broker Coordinates authentication through external identity providers if you configure your organization to use an external identity provider\u2014such as Google, Azure Active Directory, or Okta\u2014instead of Splashtop Secure Workspace identity-related services. Cloud-based network edge services Cloud resources enable Splashtop Secure Workspace to set up virtual servers as hosts in geographically diverse locations to establish multiple points of presence (PoPs) that define the Splashtop Secure Workspace network edge. These virtual servers in multiple locations are an important part of how Splashtop Secure Workspace can offer fast performance with low latency. Each point of presence provides the same set of edge services to clients and applications. The regional virtual servers allow connections through regional gateways so data processing and data storage remain within the same geographic region where the point of presence was established. In addition to handling network traffic for a region, the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge provides the services for the Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal. The Splashtop Secure Workspace web-based portal is the most common way for users to access applications. The portal is a virtual client that runs in the Splashtop Secure Workspace point of presence. By connecting to the network through the closest point of presence, users experience better application performance than over a traditional virtual private network (VPN). Now that you've had a closer look at the Splashtop Secure Workspace architecture, you can see how these core components work together in the following diagram. Connectors for internal network applications Although the core components of Splashtop Secure Workspace are cloud-based services, many organizations rely on internal applications that run on an internal, private network and, often, inside of a security perimeter such as a firewall. In most cases, applications that run on the private network aren't accessible to outside users\u2014like partners, vendors, and contractors\u2014unless you have a federated identity solution. The Splashtop Secure Workspace connector is a service you can install on computers in your internal network that aren't accessible because they are inside of a firewall or are otherwise protected. Connectors create a secure unidirectional connection from within the network so that traffic can pass through the firewall or other protection to the connector service running in the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge. The Splashtop Secure Workspace edge routes traffic from there to the users who need access to the internal application. All data passed from the connector and between the edge services and the user is strongly encrypted to ensure data security. Because the Splashtop Secure Workspace connector service connects directly to the Splashtop Secure Workspace edge from within the private network, the connector doesn't require changes to your existing security or exposing an access point that would make your infrastructure more vulnerable to attack. You can install Splashtop Secure Workspace connectors directly on macOS, Windows, or Linux computers that host internal applications. You can also run the connector as a service from the Linux command line, a Kubernetes repository, or a Docker image.","title":"Basic concepts and components"},{"location":"welcome/basic-concepts-and-components/#architecture-overview","text":"At a high level, Splashtop Secure Workspace platform consists of the following core components: The Splashtop Secure Workspace app represents the clients that run on computers and devices that need access to applications.

For example, an organization might be a global business, a school district, or a regional government agency. However, organizations aren't defined by their size. Organization are defined by the scope of what they contain. Each organization is an independent entity with its own users, groups, applications, network topology, and policies. For example, an enterprise with multiple divisions might have separate organizations for engineering and sales because engineering and sales have very different sets of users and applications to manage and share very little infrastructure. It's important to keep this separation in mind because each organization is managed completely independent from all other organizations. Users in one organization don't have access to resources in any other organization. Roles and privileges In Splashtop Secure Workspace, roles define what users can do. Roles are predefined as part of Splashtop Secure Workspace. Roles aren't defined by organizations or tenants. Each predefined role has specific privileges and restrictions. You can't modify role privileges and restrictions or add new roles to the predefined set. Roles control the features that different classes of users can access. Each user you add to an organization you manage must be assigned one of the following predefined roles: User is the most restricted role with the fewest privileges. People assigned the User role can access and use an organization\u2019s applications, manage their own secrets, and monitor their own Splashtop Secure Workspace activities. This predefined role is the role most often assigned to new Splashtop Secure Workspace users. Analyzer has the same privileges as the User role, but can also monitor the Splashtop Secure Workspace activities of other users within the organization. For example, you might assign the Analyzer role to members of the IT staff to allow them to check other users' actions or to a compliance manager who wants to monitor activity for possible security risks. Manager has the same privileges as the Analyzer role, but can also add and modify access to applications within an organization. For example, you might assign the Manager role to an application owner in a specific department or to an IT manager working under the senior-level IT administrator. Org Admin has all administrative privileges within a single organization. Accounts that are assigned the Org Admin role can use all Splashtop Secure Workspace features, including creating user accounts, setting device configuration and posture checks, and much more. Super Admin has all administrative privileges, but is not restricted to a single organization. Accounts that are assigned the Super Admin role have access to all organizations in their tenant instance and can add, modify, and delete organizations in their instance. This role is associated with a Splashtop Secure Workspace service account. Users who sign in with a service account can choose to work with any of their organizations, but they can only make changes to any one of those organizations at a time. Auditor has the read-only privileges to view any Splashtop Secure Workspace information, including configuration settings, event logs, user activity, and anything that a Super Admin might see. Users in the Auditor role can\u2019t perform any administrative actions. Groups Unlike the predefined roles, organization administrators can use groups to define sets of users that share common privileges or requirements. For example, you can use groups for users who access the same set of applications or to apply access policies for users in the same location. Groups allow you to implement privileges and restrictions for multiple users at a time based on the criteria you define. Guests Guests are application users who don't have Splashtop Secure Workspace accounts. Guests aren\u2019t part of the organization you manage, but might periodically or regularly need access to resources in the organization. For example, you might have an outside party\u2014a partner, vendor, contractor, or temporary employee\u2014who requires short-term or temporary access to a server or application. In this scenario, you want to grant limited access without adding the outside party as a Splashtop Secure Workspace user with an account in the organization you manage. You can give guests temporary access to applications by sending them a URL and credentials. The guest uses the URL to present the credentials you provided and is granted access to the application through Splashtop Secure Workspace without seeing or using any of Splashtop Secure Workspace features.","title":"Organizations and roles"},{"location":"welcome/organizations-and-roles/#roles-and-privileges","text":"In Splashtop Secure Workspace, roles define what users can do.
