By default, Splashtop Secure Workspace displays information about active sessions and records information about sessions that are no longer active to give you visibility into user and application activity both in real-time and in historical context. You can also terminate active sessions individually or as a bulk operation. For example, if you see suspicious activity, you can select multiple active sessions, the click **Bulk Terminate** to close all of the sessions at once.


## Events

With the Event Explorer, you can view event logs investigate activity in your organization using histograms and facet navigation. By selecting and filtering events, you can analyze data and gain valuable insights into user activities and system events.

With the ability to navigate event logs, monitor sessions in real-time, and review session recordings, admins have the necessary tools to ensure the integrity and safety of the Splashtop Secure Workspace.
