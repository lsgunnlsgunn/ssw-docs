Before your organization's users can use Splashtop Secure Workspace to access applications and resources, they need to have an account. There are a few different ways you can add users to your organization.
You can add users:

* By adding account information for each user manually.
* By sending an email invitation to one or more valid email addresses.
* By importing accounts from an external identity provider like Google Workplace, Azure Active Directory, Okta, or GitHub.

After users in your organization have a Splashtop Secure Workspace account, you can manage their access rights, organize them into groups, and assign policies and permissions.
