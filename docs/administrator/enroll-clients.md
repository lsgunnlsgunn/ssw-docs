Before your organization's users can use Splashtop Secure Workspace to access applications and resources, they need to have an account. There are a few different ways you can add users to your organization.
You can add users:

* By adding account information for each user manually.
* By sending an email invitation to one or more valid email addresses.
* By importing accounts from an external identity provider like Google Workplace, Azure Active Directory, Okta, or GitHub.

After you add user accounts to your organization using the Splashtop Secure Workspace administrative portal, you can manage their account information, organize them into groups, and assign policies and permissions.

## Add users manually


## Send email invitations


## Add users from identity providers
