Splashtop Secure Workspace allows you to give users access to applications quickly and efficiently, regardless of whether those applications are on internal servers or hosted in the cloud. 
There are a few different ways you can add applications to the Splashtop Secure Workspace network.

For example, you can add applications automatically by running a connector on an internal network and allowing the connector to scan for one or more application protocols. 
With application discovery, Splashtop Secure Workspace can automatically find many types of applications that use the following connection protocols:

* Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS).
* Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
* Virtual Network Connection (VNC).
* Splashtop Desktop Protocol (SDP).
* Secure Shell (SSH).
* Kubernetes client API.
* Telnet protocol.

The following topics cover adding applications:

* [Add discovered applications](./add-discovered-apps.md)
* [Add private applications](./add-private-applications.md)
* [Add public applications](./add-public-applications.md)
