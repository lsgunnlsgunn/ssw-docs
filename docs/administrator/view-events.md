In Events, Splashtop Secure Workspace allows you to access detailed logs of events happening across your workspace environment. This provides valuable insights into user activities and system events, enabling you to monitor and troubleshoot issues effectively.

The Events section provides centralized access to view of event logs in Splashtop Secure Workspace. With the ability to filter logs based on time, apply column-based filters, and analyze logs using the histogram and table views, you can effectively monitor and investigate events within your workspace environment.


Filter Section
The Filter section allows you to refine the event logs displayed on the page. You can adjust the time range using the time picker and apply column-based filters to modify the content shown. By selecting specific criteria, you can narrow down the event logs to focus on relevant information.
