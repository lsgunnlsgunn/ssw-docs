Public applications are applications that you access over the internet using a public endpoint URL.

Adding public applications to Splashtop Secure Workspace requires you to provide information about how users sign in to use the application, including the authentication protocol, the service provider's endpoint URL, and the identity providers that can be used to authenticate the user signing in. All of this information is highly dependent on the public application service provider.

To add a public application:

1. Sign in to your organization URL using your administrative account.

2. Click **Applications**, then click **Applications**.

3. Click **Add Applications**, then select **Public Application**. 

4. For the General Settings, provide the following information:
   * Type the **Application name**.
   * Type the **Display name** to use for the application.
   * Select an **Icon** to use for the application.
   
The rest of the information you must provide is highly dependent on the public application service provider. The instructions in the following sections provide a simplified example that you can use as a general model.

  ## Set sign-on options
  
 
  ## Set group and policy options


  ## Set identity provider options
