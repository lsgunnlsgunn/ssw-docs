There are many security products and platforms available on the market, but most of them target large-scale enterprises or focus narrowly on a specific aspect of security. As a result, most organizations address security through a patchwork of individual products or an expensive, complex, and hard to deploy solution that requires a large and experienced IT staff to implement.

By contrast, Splashtop Secure Workspace provides broad and deep coverage to secure all key aspects of an organization but with a focus on simplicity, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

## Security simplified

The following examples highlight some of the ways that the Splashtop Secure Workspace integrated approach to simplifying security can benefit your organization.

- **Policy-based enforcement of the “least privilege” principle**. With Splashtop Secure Workspace, you can use a single administrative portal to set security policies, including policies for user authentication, secrets handling, and application access. For example, you can allow or deny access to specific applications based on a user's location, device posture, time constraints, or other factors.

- **Browser-based access across protocols**. Splashtop Secure Workspace supports secure access to all web and network applications—including through SSH, RDP, VNC, Telnet, and Kubernetes—using a browser. You can access any application from a browser without installing additional agents. However, Splashtop Secure Workspace also has mobile apps and browser extensions that provide convenience features to enhance the user experience.

- **Comprehensive identity access management**. Splashtop Secure Workspace offers built-in user and group management, customizable user onboarding, and advanced controls, such as conditional authentication and conditional multifactor authentication. You can also integrate Splashtop Secure Workspace with identity providers like Google or Microsoft, or with identity management tools that are based on SAML, OIDC, OAuth, and SCIM standards for users and groups.

- **Service-based deployment**. You can deploy Splashtop Secure Workspace connectors programmatically anywhere you need them without installing agents on your remote servers.

## Access from everywhere
Splashtop Secure Workspace is a cross-platform solution that can secure your entire infrastructure.

- **Network access everywhere**. Splashtop Secure Workspace guarantees zero-trust access to both on-premises and cloud resources on all major operating systems. The Secure Workspace app ensures zero-trust access to enable remote and hybrid work for businesses with end-to-end protection and comprehensive IT controls.

## Control access and secrets

Splashtop Secure Workspace helps secure your infrastructure by keeping secrets secret, and ensuring that the devices used to connect to your network are secure.

- **Secure third-party privileged access**. With Splashtop Secure Workspace, you can grant third parties access to resources using elevated privileges without exposing the privileged credentials.

- **Built-in secrets management**. Splashtop Secure Workspace includes a secrets manager for secure storage, sharing, and access to account credentials and other sensitive data. The sensitive information is protected by a strong authentication key derived from a master password known only to the user. In addition, the IT administrator can enforce policies to protect access to secrets and sensitive data.

- **Secure device posture enforcement**. Splashtop Secure Workspace device checking helps you ensure that devices with access to network resources meet specific security standards. For example, you can require devices to have file encryption enabled or a specific minimum operating system version before they can be used to connect to the network.
