As the organization administrator, you can authorize access for users, groups, and devices, define the conditions and policies that allow or deny access, keep watch over network activity, and perform many other important administrative tasks to secure the organization. 

To see how to perform these tasks using Splashtop Secure Workspace, let’s start by adding a test user and group to the organization. You can then use the test user and group to test access to resources and applications. You can add users individually one at a time, all at once from an external identity provider, or in groups by sending out email invitations. 

For the sake of the _Quick start_, let’s assume you have some test email accounts for the organization and can use those email accounts to add users. 

To invite users: 

1. Open the administrative portal.

2. Click Access, then click **Users**. 

3. Click **Invite Users**. 

4. Type the email address for a test user account. 

    If you want to add more than one user with the same settings, click the plus sign (+) and type another email address. 

1. Leave the other settings unchanged to add a user with no special permissions.

2. Click **Save** to send the email invitation. 

3. Go to another device and open the email invitation

4. Click **Get started** and activate the test account. 

You now have two accounts—the organization administrative account and a basic user account—for you to test different scenarios. For example, you can use the account you just assigned the User role to access an application using the Splashtop Secure Workspace desktop client application.
